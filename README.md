Case Story: Analyzing MEAP Test Scores and School Expenditures in Michigan
The Michigan Educational Assessment Programme (MEAP) is an annual standardised test that evaluates the proficiency of students in Michigan in core subjects, including math and reading. In the year 2001, data was gathered on the MEAP test scores for mathematics and reading from multiple schools throughout Michigan. Additionally, information regarding the expenditure per pupil was also collected. A dataset named MEAP01.RAW was generated for analytical purposes. The dataset contains information on the math and reading test scores of each school, represented by the variables math4 and read4, respectively. The scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater proficiency. The dataset also contains information on the expenditure per pupil for each school, represented by the variable exppp. In order to conduct data analysis, a number of inquiries were formulated. The initial inquiry pertained to determining the range of math4 scores, specifically the maximum and minimum values. The second inquiry aimed to ascertain the number of schools that achieved a flawless pass rate on the maths test, denoted by a score of 100, and the corresponding percentage of the overall sample. The third inquiry aimed to ascertain the number of educational institutions that exhibited a mathematics passing rate of precisely 50 percent. The fourth inquiry entailed a comparison of the mean pass rates between the maths and reading assessments, with the objective of ascertaining the relatively more challenging test to pass. The fifth inquiry pertained to determining the correlation between the mathematical proficiency of fourth-grade students and their reading comprehension abilities, followed by drawing appropriate conclusions based on the findings. The ultimate inquiry entailed ascertaining the mean expenditure per student along with its corresponding standard deviation, and evaluating the extent of variation in spending per pupil.  
The analysis was conducted using the STATA programming language.
